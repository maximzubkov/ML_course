## Project 1

The repository is structured as follows:
* In the `run.py` script, we placed all the code for reproducing the results. In `run.py` only raw code is stored, a detailed explanation of what approaches we used is placed in notebook `main.ipynb`.
* All the methods implementations are in `implementations.py`.
* Metric that we utilize for evaluation of our models are stored in `metric.py`.
* Final prediction on the test set, produced by `run.py` are stored in `results.csv`.

Note that to run the notebook or `run.py` it is essential to unzip files `train.csv.zip` and `test.csv.zip` from `data` folder
